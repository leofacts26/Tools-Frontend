        <Typography className="terms-heading">2) Our Story</Typography>

        <Typography className="terms-text">
          GanakaHub started as a small idea — building just one calculator for
          personal use. But as friends, students, and professionals began asking
          for more tools, we expanded into a full platform offering calculators
          for:
        </Typography>

        <ul className="terms-list">
          <li>Finance & Investments (SIP, EPF, NPS, Gratuity, Lumpsum)</li>
          <li>Student Life (GPA, Attendance, Study Timer)</li>
          <li>Daily Utilities (percentage tools, converters, timers)</li>
        </ul>

        <Typography className="terms-text">
          What started as a hobby project has grown into a platform used by
          thousands of people daily. And we continue improving based on user
          feedback and real-world needs.
