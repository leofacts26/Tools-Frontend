          "Most people think becoming a crorepati before 35 needs a big salary or business. But the truth is — it only needs one simple rule: Consistency with Compounding.",
          "Imagine this — you start investing just ₹5000 every month at age 25 through an SIP (Systematic Investment Plan). It feels small, right? But if you stay consistent and your money grows at around 12% yearly (which is realistic for long-term mutual funds), by the time you’re 35, you’ll be sitting on almost ₹11.6 lakh.",
          "Not impressed yet? Now here’s the twist — if every year you just increase your SIP by 10%, your monthly amount slowly grows, and your total after 10 years jumps to around ₹19–20 lakh.",
          "But that’s just the start. If you keep doing this till you’re 45, this habit — not luck, not big income — quietly turns into a crore or more. It’s the math of patience.",
          "The earlier you start, the lesser you need later.",
          "The question is — will you wait for “more income” to start investing, or will you start now and let time work for you?"

          "This is where the Step-Up SIP comes in — the real game changer. Let’s say you start with ₹5000 a month at age 25. Every year, when your salary increases, you raise your SIP by just 10%. That means ₹5500 next year, ₹6050 after that — hardly noticeable, right? But over time, this small step-up creates a huge difference.",
          "By the time you’re 35, your total invested amount might be around ₹9 lakh — but your wealth could be close to ₹20 lakh or more, thanks to compounding on growing contributions.",
          "This isn’t about how much you earn, it’s about how you grow what you invest.",
          "The truth is, financial growth isn’t built in big leaps — it’s built in small, consistent climbs. Every small increase you make today becomes a mountain tomorrow.",

          "Let’s take two friends — Rohan and Aman. Rohan starts investing ₹5000 a month at 25. Aman waits till 30 to start, thinking he’ll earn more later and invest double, ₹10,000 monthly. By 45, guess who has more money? Surprisingly, Rohan, even though he invested less every month.",
          "Why? Because his money got five extra years to grow — and those years doubled his wealth without him doing anything extra.",
          "That’s the magic of compounding — it rewards the early starters, not the late planners. Waiting for the “perfect time” is like standing at a train station watching opportunities pass by.",
          "You don’t need to be rich to start — you just need to start early and stay patient. Every month you delay is a month your money could’ve worked for you.",

          "We Indians are taught from childhood — “Save money, don’t waste it.” So we grow up believing that saving alone will make us rich. But here’s the hard truth — saving is not enough. Keeping money in your bank account is like planting a seed in a jar; it will never grow. Inflation quietly eats it away every single year. You think you’re being careful, but in reality, your money is losing power.",
          "Now imagine this — instead of letting ₹10,000 sit in your account, you invest it through SIPs. That same amount, if left to compound for 15–20 years, can turn into lakhs. The difference isn’t in how much you saved — it’s in what you did after saving. Smart people don’t just save; they make their savings work.",
          "The middle-class trap is playing it too safe — scared of risk, scared of change. But the real risk is doing nothing.",
          "Money grows only when it moves — through learning, through investing, through action.",
          "So ask yourself — are you protecting your money, or are you letting it grow? Because the middle-class mindset keeps you safe today, but broke tomorrow."

They invest for a year or two, then stop when expenses rise or markets fall. But real wealth isn’t built in excitement — it’s built in consistency.",
          "The people who become crorepatis before 35 are not the ones who earn the most; they are the ones who stay the longest.",
          "Think of it like fitness — you don’t get results by going to the gym once. You get results by showing up every single day, even when you don’t feel like it. SIPs work the same way. Every month you invest, you’re building a stronger version of your financial future — silently, patiently, and automatically.",
          "This journey isn’t just about money. It’s about self-control, delayed gratification, and trust in the process.",
          "The rule that makes you rich is simple: Invest first, spend later. Do this for 10 years, and you won’t just have money — you’ll have freedom.",
