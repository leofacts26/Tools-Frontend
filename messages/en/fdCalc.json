        "Unlike savings accounts, FD interest rates are higher because funds are locked for the tenure you choose; early withdrawal typically incurs a penalty.",
        "FDs can be simple-interest (interest paid but not compounded) or compound-interest (interest reinvests and itself earns interest), and they may offer special categories — senior citizen FD, tax-saving FD, flexi-FD, and sweep-in FD.",
        "Interest compounding frequency (annual, semiannual, quarterly, monthly) influences returns: more frequent compounding usually yields a higher maturity amount.",
