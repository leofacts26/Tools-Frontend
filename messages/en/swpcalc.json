      "q": "Is SWP only useful after retirement?",
      "a": "No. While SWPs are very popular among retirees for generating monthly income, they are equally useful for professionals, business owners, and parents planning for regular expenses like EMIs, tuition fees, or household bills."
    },
    {
      "q": "Will my investment continue to grow if I start an SWP?",
      "a": "Yes. Even after you withdraw a fixed amount, the remaining corpus stays invested in the mutual fund. This allows your money to potentially grow over time, depending on market performance."
    },
    {
      "q": "How accurate is the SWP Calculator?",
      "a": "The SWP Calculator gives accurate projections based on the inputs you provide—investment amount, withdrawal, tenure, and expected return rate. However, since mutual funds are market-linked, the actual returns may vary from the estimates."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I change or stop my SWP midway?",
      "a": "Yes. SWPs are highly flexible. You can increase, decrease, pause, or even stop withdrawals anytime as per your changing financial needs."
    },
    {
      "q": "Is SWP better than a fixed deposit for monthly income?",
      "a": "For many investors, yes. Fixed deposits give guaranteed but fully taxable interest, whereas SWPs provide flexible withdrawals, potential market-linked growth, and better tax efficiency through capital gains taxation."
