        "An RD Calculator instantly converts your monthly deposit, interest rate, and tenure into the final maturity amount and total interest earned, removing the need for manual calculations.",

        "A Recurring Deposit (RD) is a disciplined, low-risk saving scheme offered by banks, NBFCs, and post offices that allows individuals to invest a fixed amount every month for a specific tenure. It is ideal for salaried individuals or anyone who prefers systematic savings over a lump-sum investment.",
        "Unlike Fixed Deposits where you deposit once, an RD helps you build wealth gradually through monthly installments that earn compound interest over time. The interest rate is usually similar to FDs, but because the investment happens monthly, each installment earns interest for a different duration until maturity.",
        "Recurring Deposits can have tenures ranging from 6 months to 10 years, with flexible monthly contributions based on your savings capacity. Senior citizens often enjoy slightly higher rates.",
        "Use an RD Calculator to understand how your monthly contributions, interest rate, and compounding frequency together determine your maturity value — so you can plan savings for short- or long-term financial goals effectively."
