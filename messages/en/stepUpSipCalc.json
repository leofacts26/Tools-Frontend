        "A Step Up SIP Calculator helps you project how an automated annual increase in your SIP contributions accelerates wealth creation.",
        "Unlike a regular SIP where the monthly amount stays constant, a step-up SIP increases your instalment by a fixed percentage each year (for example, +10% annually).",
        "This mirrors real-life salary growth and makes long-term goals easier to reach without large upfront changes to your budget.",
        "The calculator converts your starting monthly SIP, annual step-up rate, expected fund return (CAGR) and tenure into a clear maturity value, total invested, and total gains.",
        "Use it to plan goal-based investing (home, child education, retirement), to decide a comfortable initial SIP amount, and to visualise how modest annual top-ups compound into substantial wealth over time."

        "A Step Up SIP (also called top-up SIP) is a systematic investment plan where your monthly contribution increases at predetermined intervals—commonly once per year—by a fixed percentage or fixed amount.",
        "For example, you may start with ₹5,000/month in year 1, then increase by 10% to ₹5,500/month in year 2, and continue the same rule in subsequent years.",
        "The idea is to align savings with rising income: small incremental increases are easier to sustain than a big, one-time jump.",
        "Unlike a one-time lump sum, step-up SIP preserves the rupee cost averaging benefit while adding the power of rising contributions.",
        "Funds invested through Step Up SIPs stay invested and compound at the scheme’s returns, making this strategy powerful for long-term goals.",
