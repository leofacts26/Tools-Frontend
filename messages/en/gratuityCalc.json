        "Gratuity is a lump-sum payment made by an employer to an employee as a reward for long and continuous service, governed in India by the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 for covered establishments.",
        "Under the Act, an employee becomes eligible for gratuity after completing five years of continuous service; the five-year rule is waived in cases of death or permanent disablement resulting from injury or illness.",
        "The benefit is typically calculated using the employee’s last drawn basic salary plus dearness allowance and the number of years of service; some employers offer more generous schemes but cannot pay less than the statutory minimum.",

        "Government employees may have different rules for gratuity payment and taxation, governed by their respective service conditions.",
