        "Simple interest is the quickest way to calculate interest on a principal when interest does not compound.",
        "If you have short-term loans, certain savings products, or structured repayments where interest is charged only on the original principal, a Simple Interest Calculator gives you exact numbers in seconds.",
        "Instead of manually applying formulas or risking arithmetic mistakes, the calculator takes your principal, annual rate and time period and produces the interest and total amount payable at maturity.",
        "It’s ideal for students, borrowers, lenders and small-business owners who need a no-nonsense view of interest costs and outcomes.",
        "Use the tool to compare offers, budget repayments, or check how much a short-term investment will yield without compounding."

      "heading": "What is Simple Interest? — Simple Interest Calculator Context",
      "paragraphs": [
        "Simple interest is the interest computed only on the original principal throughout the investment or loan tenure. Unlike compound interest — where accrued interest is periodically added back to principal so interest earns interest — simple interest treats the principal as fixed.",
        "Common use cases include short-term loans, certain bond coupons, vehicle loans with flat-rate structures, and short-duration promissory notes. The simplicity makes calculations transparent: the interest grows linearly with time. That predictability is useful for budgeting and comparing offers.",
        "However, for most long-term investments and many bank products, compound interest usually provides higher returns (or higher costs for borrowers).",
        "A Simple Interest Calculator helps you compute: (1) the Simple Interest (SI) earned/owed, and (2) the Total Amount (A) = principal + SI — making comparisons and decisions fast and reliable."
