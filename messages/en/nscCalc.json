        "The National Savings Certificate (NSC) is a safe, government-backed savings product widely used by Indian investors for capital preservation and tax savings.",
        "Because NSC interest is compounded annually and paid at maturity, the final payoff depends on both the invested sum and the applicable compound rate — which the government may revise quarterly.",
        "An NSC Calculator removes the manual math: enter the principal and applicable interest rate and the tool returns the maturity amount, effective annual yield and total interest earned for the 5-year term.",
        "This lets you compare NSC returns with other safe instruments (PPF, Post Office FD), plan 80C tax claims, and decide the right investment amount to match your financial goals."

        "The National Savings Certificate (NSC) is a long-term, fixed-income savings scheme offered at post offices across India and backed by the Government of India.",
        "NSC has a standard lock-in of five years and pays a fixed rate of interest that is compounded annually and credited at maturity.",
        "NSC investments qualify for deduction under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act (subject to the overall ₹1.5 lakh limit), which makes it attractive for taxpayers seeking tax-efficient, low-risk instruments.",
        "There’s a low minimum entry — investments can be started with small sums — and there is effectively no upper limit on how much you can invest, though practical limits may arise from 80C considerations.",
        "Because it is government-guaranteed, NSC is often preferred by conservative savers who prioritise capital safety and predictable returns."

The calculator will compute this exactly and display both A and the total interest A − P. Use the year-wise breakdown to see how reinvested interest accelerates growth."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "q": "What is an NSC Calculator?",
      "a": "An NSC Calculator helps you estimate the maturity value of your National Savings Certificate based on the current interest rate and investment amount."
    },
    {
      "q": "How does an NSC Calculator work?",
      "a": "It uses the official NSC interest rate and applies annual compounding for the fixed 5-year tenure to show the total amount you will receive at maturity."
    },
    {
      "q": "Is the NSC Calculator result accurate?",
      "a": "The calculator provides accurate estimates based on the current interest rate, but the actual maturity value may change if the government revises the interest rate before purchase."
    },
    {
      "q": "What is the tenure used in the NSC Calculator?",
      "a": "The NSC has a fixed lock-in period of 5 years, so the calculator uses this tenure to compute the maturity amount."
    },
    {
      "q": "Does the calculator include tax benefits?",
      "a": "The calculator shows only the maturity amount. However, NSC investments qualify for Section 80C deductions up to ₹1.5 lakh per year."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I calculate returns for different investment amounts?",
      "a": "Yes. You can enter any principal amount, and the calculator will show the final maturity value based on the current NSC interest rate."
    },
    {
      "q": "Does the NSC Calculator include TDS or tax on interest?",
      "a": "No. The calculator does not factor in taxes. NSC interest is taxable, but no TDS is deducted—tax is paid at the time of filing returns."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can the NSC Calculator be used for older NSC certificates?",
      "a": "Yes, but you must enter the interest rate applicable during the year you purchased the certificate to get accurate results."
