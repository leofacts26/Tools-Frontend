        "The National Savings Certificate (NSC) is a safe, government-backed savings product widely used by Indian investors for capital preservation and tax savings.",
        "Because NSC interest is compounded annually and paid at maturity, the final payoff depends on both the invested sum and the applicable compound rate — which the government may revise quarterly.",
        "An NSC Calculator removes the manual math: enter the principal and applicable interest rate and the tool returns the maturity amount, effective annual yield and total interest earned for the 5-year term.",
        "This lets you compare NSC returns with other safe instruments (PPF, Post Office FD), plan 80C tax claims, and decide the right investment amount to match your financial goals."

        "The National Savings Certificate (NSC) is a long-term, fixed-income savings scheme offered at post offices across India and backed by the Government of India.",
        "NSC has a standard lock-in of five years and pays a fixed rate of interest that is compounded annually and credited at maturity.",
        "NSC investments qualify for deduction under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act (subject to the overall ₹1.5 lakh limit), which makes it attractive for taxpayers seeking tax-efficient, low-risk instruments.",
        "There’s a low minimum entry — investments can be started with small sums — and there is effectively no upper limit on how much you can invest, though practical limits may arise from 80C considerations.",
        "Because it is government-guaranteed, NSC is often preferred by conservative savers who prioritise capital safety and predictable returns."

        "Tax treatment flag (optional) — whether you plan to claim Section 80C for this amount."

The calculator will compute this exactly and display both A and the total interest A − P. Use the year-wise breakdown to see how reinvested interest accelerates growth."
